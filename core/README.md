# System Core Documentation
This is where the documentation for the system core will go

## Using the core

### Downloading the shape predictor model
Because the shape predictor model is huge (by git standards) it is not included
with this repository. You can download the model by running `download_model.sh`,
or by locating your own copy of dlib's `shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks` and
saving it as `shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat` in this directory.

### Embedding the core within an application

Embedding instructions coming soon!

## How it works

TODO: Write documentation about how it works.
